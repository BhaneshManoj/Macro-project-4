# Macro-project-4

## Part 1 Overview
**Using Dynare‚Äôs perfect foresight solver, the simulation generates impulse response functions (IRFs) for key macroeconomic variables, including output, consumption, capital, and labor. The model framework includes standard equilibrium conditions, such as the Euler equation, labor-leisure tradeoff, capital accumulation, and firm pricing decisions under monopolistic competition.**

## Part 2 Overview

This project explores how the U.S. labor market evolved before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic using microdata from the Current Population Survey (CPS). It focuses on three labor market states:

- **Employed** (working full/part-time)  
- **Unemployed** (not working but actively looking)  
- **Not in the labor force** (not working and not looking)

The analysis includes:
- Monthly unemployment and nonparticipation rates  
- Transition probabilities between labor market states  
- A written memo discussing trends and recovery patterns
